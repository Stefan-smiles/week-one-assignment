# week-one-assignment
//this assignment was alot of fun. I think that after I have handed this in I may actually continue to build the site and as my skills develop I hope to make the site more interactive. one modification I hope to make is to replace the text used as a button to move I think I will instead create a glossary and a search bar to be able to navigate through the site.
