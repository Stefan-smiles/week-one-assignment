      <h2 class="description">A Brief Decsription of a Demon</h2>
      <p class="decribe">
        A demon is a spiritual, noncorporeal being that is believed to be
        malevolent and seek to harm humans. Demons are often depicted in
        religious iconography as hybrid creatures or caricatures of opposing
        religions. In the Christian tradition, demons are angels who fell from
        grace. <br /><br /><br />A demon can also refer to a source of evil,
        harm, distress, or ruin. For example, someone might refer to drug or
        alcohol addiction as a demon. The word “demon” comes from the Greek word
        daimōn, which can refer to a variety of beings, not just evil ones.
